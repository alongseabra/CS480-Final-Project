# CS480 Anson, Jay, Alec, Daniel Final Project

## Installation & Setup

### Overview

To run this project you need to run the script: 
 _MainScript.py_ – this will run the program building and testing a neural network.
 

### Dependencies
You will need these libraries:

- sys - should be installed by default
- tensorflow - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- PIL – [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org)

### Installing TensorFlow
 The [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/index.html) will be good help if you have trouble doing this.

### Installing Python Image Library (PIL) (*Niek's own words here*)
The Python Image Library (PIL) is no longer available. Luckily there is a good fork called Pillow. Installing is as easy as:

```sudo pip install Pillow```

Or look at the [Pillow documentation ](http://pillow.readthedocs.org) for other installation options.

### The python scripts
The easiest way the use the scripts is to put all four scripts in the same folder. If TensorFlow is installed correctly the images to train the model are downloaded automatically. 

## Running
To run the script do the following

1. Run MainScript.py
2. Supply the directory where your test files are stored, default is 'test_data'
3. Provide a gradient value; we recommend 0.01
